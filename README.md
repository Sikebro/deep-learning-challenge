# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21
<h2>Report on the Neural Network Model</h2>
For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

<h3><strong>Overview of the analysis:</strong></h3>
<p>The goal of this analysis is to develop a binary classification model that can predict whether an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will succeed based on the attributes in the dataset.</p>

<h3><strong>Results:</strong></h3>
Data Preprocessing
<ul>
<li>What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? - The target model for this was IS_SUCCESSFUL </li>
<li>What variable(s) are the features for your model? - ENI and NAME were the features for this model</li>
<li>What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? - stating from the previous question ENI and NAME are the variables that should be removed</li>
</ul>

</h3><strong></strong>Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? - I used a couple different values for each to see if the target value could be reached.</li>
<li>Were you able to achieve the target model performance? - No I was not able to the best was around 73%</li>
<li>What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? I tried using different cut-off values as well as different layers </li>
</ul>


<h3><strong>Summary: </strong></h3>
<p>The model had good results but not the performance we were looking for, this model was not able to reach the targeted 75%, I could have limited different variables or changed a couple of values
to see if the performance would be any different.</p>
