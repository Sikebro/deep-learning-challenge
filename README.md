# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21
<h2>Report on the Neural Network Model</h2>
For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

<h3><strong>Overview of the analysis:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Results:</strong>

Data Preprocessing
<ol>
<li>What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? - The target model for this was IS_SUCCESSFUL </li>
<li>What variable(s) are the features for your model? - ENI and NAME were the features for this model</li>
<li>What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? - stating from from previous question ENI and NAME are the variables that should be removed</li>
</ol>

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
